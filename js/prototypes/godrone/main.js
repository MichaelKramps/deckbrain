// Going back to the slots mechanic
// You have a number of slots that you can attach various objects into
// These objects do things automatically without intervention
// 1. Guns that do damage each turn
// 2. Factories that create ships to send on to the battlefield
// 3. Repair stations that heal damaged units
// 4. Upgrade stations that improve existing units
// 5. Anything else you can think of
//
// Additional mechanics ideas
// 1. Common card pool? - you don't get your own deck, you and your opponent select from the same group of cards
// 2. Lanes - The battle is fought along 3 lanes (like LoL), like 3 mini battles
// 3. Winning - The game is won when all your opponent's objects have been destroyed
// 2. Hidden information - Backup objects are hidden until they enter play
//    - When an object is destroyed, a new object will automatically take its place
//    - A player can manually destroy his own object to allow the backup to take over
// 3. Resource allocation - You have energy/resources to spend and get to decide how they are distributed each turn
//    - Your slotted objects can only activate if they have enough resource allocation
