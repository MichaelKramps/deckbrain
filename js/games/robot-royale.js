// Game Ideas
//
// Have stages with a few enemies and a boss (victory gives you rewards to choose from)
// In order to avoid use of a database use progress codes (like Mega Man X)
//
// Two game modes (Campaign and Endless Arena)
// Campaign to more easily gain experience and items
// Endless arena to measure the strength of your team and get rare items
